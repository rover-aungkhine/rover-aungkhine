#### Hey, my name is Aung Khine Moe 👋

My career began in Civil Engineering but I am now transitioning into the fields of Data Analytics. Currently, I am actively studying AI, ML, Python, and Data Analytics, building a strong foundation in these areas. Along the way, I have gained experience in digital marketing as a co-founder of Digital Marketing Agency. 

My ultimate goal is to become a professional data analyst and help business grow together with me!
